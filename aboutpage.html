<br>
<p id="three"><p>Also, I am extremely intrigued by technology. As a kid I was always taking apart and fixing things myself if they were broken. I've taken apart computers, playstations, phones, bikes whatever you name it and fixed them myself. I guess I've just always liked to see how things work.</p>
<br>
